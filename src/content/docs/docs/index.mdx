# Welcome to the Pixodesk Docs.
<SpacerBottom />
This documentation is currently in development and will eventually describe how to create, edit, save, and export static SVGs, Lottie animations, and SVG animations using Pixodesk applications.

Each application is designed to work with specific graphics and animation types:

- **Pixodesk SVG Editor** for static SVGs
    <SpacerBottom size='1rem'/>
- **Pixodesk 2D Animator** for Lottie animations
    <SpacerBottom size='1rem'/>
- **Pixodesk SVG Animator** for SVG animations
    <SpacerBottom size='2rem'/>
The documentation is divided into sub-sections. Each subsection represents a part of the workflow, from creating animations to embedding them into different types of projects (websites, static site generators, frameworks, and native applications), as well as modifying them on the fly.
<SpacerBottom size='1rem'/>
The **How to Add Lottie** section explains how to add your Lottie animations to different project types and how to modify them dynamically to see the results immediately.
