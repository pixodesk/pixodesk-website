# Add Lottie Animation to React Project

<SpacerBottom /> 
You can add Lottie animations to a React app using the `lottie-react` package. 
<SpacerBottom size='1rem'/> 
It is a **React-specific Lottie player**. It adapts the player to React components, lets you control it via props, and integrates smoothly with the React lifecycle. 
<SpacerBottom size='1rem'/> 
The steps to add a Lottie animation to a React project are: 
<SpacerBottom size='1rem'/> 
- Create a React project 
- Install Lottie for React 
- Add your Lottie animation to the project 
- Use Lottie in a React component 
- Run your app 
- Edit the animation from the project folder (transform, colors, shapes, etc.) 
- Done! The animation is ready.

## Create React Project

```bash
cd path/to/your/projects
```
Then:

```bash
npm create vite@latest my-animation-app -- --template react-ts
```

This creates a React + TypeScript project called my-animation-app.
<SpacerBottom size='1rem' />

Go into your project folder:
```bash
cd my-animation-app
```
Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

<SpacerBottom size='1rem' />

## Install Lottie for React
<SpacerBottom />
In your React project folder, run:

```bash
npm install lottie-react
```
<SpacerBottom size='1rem' />
---

## Add Your Lottie Animation
<SpacerBottom size='1rem' />

To add a Lottie animation to your project, you can:
<SpacerBottom size='1rem' />
- create it from scratch in [`Pixodesk 2D Animator`](https://pixodesk.com/2d-animator) or 
- download an animation from [`LottieFiles`](https://lottiefiles.com) and edit it in [`2D Animator`](https://pixodesk.com/2d-animator).
<SpacerBottom size='1rem' />
In 2D Animator, you can modify all animation properties: color, stroke, shapes, animation position, scale, opacity, easing, etc.
<SpacerBottom size='1rem' />
You can combine several animations into one to achieve the desired effect.
<SpacerBottom size='1rem' />
Create an `animations` folder in `src/assets/` and add your animation:

```bash
src/assets/animations/animation.json
```
<SpacerBottom size='1rem' />
---

## Use Lottie in React Component

<SpacerBottom size='1rem' />
**src/App.tsx**
```tsx
import Lottie from "lottie-react";
import animationData from "./assets/animations/animation.json";


function App() {
    return (
        <div>
            <Lottie 
                animationData={animationData}
                loop={true}
                autoplay={true}
                style={{ width: 300, height: 300 }}
            />
            {/* ... the rest of your code */}
        </div>
    );
}

export default App;

```
<SpacerBottom size='1rem' />
---

## Run Your App

<SpacerBottom />

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should see `Local: http://localhost:5173` in your terminal window. 

<SpacerBottom size='1rem' />

**Open the link in your browser.**
<SpacerBottom size='1rem' />
**Note:** the localhost port can be different if `5173` has been taken by another application.

<SpacerBottom size='1rem' />

Your Lottie animation should now work in your React project.

- Open your animation in **`2D Animator`** straight from your `src/assets/animations` folder.
- **Modify** your file and **save** it.
