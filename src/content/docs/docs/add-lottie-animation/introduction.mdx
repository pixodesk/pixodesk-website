# Lottie File Format And Lottie Players
<SpacerBottom />
In this article, we focus on what the 
<span style="color: var(--sl-color-accent-high);">Lottie</span> animation file format is and describe some of the 
<span style="color: var(--sl-color-accent-high);">Lottie players</span> that allow Lottie animations to play across different platforms and frameworks.

## What Is Lottie?
<SpacerBottom />
Lottie is a vector animation format designed for lightweight and scalable animations. It uses `JSON` to represent animation data and was created by Airbnb in 2017.
<SpacerBottom size='1rem'/>
At its core, a Lottie animation is:
<SpacerBottom size='1rem'/>
- A **JSON** file
- **Describing animation data** such as shapes, paths, colors, transforms, and timing
- **Resolution-independent**, so it scales without losing quality
- **Fully controllable via code**, allowing you to play, pause, seek, loop, or dynamically modify properties like colors

## What Are Lottie Players?
<SpacerBottom />
A Lottie file is **only data**. By itself, it does nothing.

<SpacerBottom size='1rem'/>
A **Lottie player** is the runtime that:
<SpacerBottom size='1rem'/>
- **Reads** the Lottie JSON file
- **Interprets** the animation instructions
- **Renders** the animation using SVG, Canvas, or native drawing APIs (iOS / Android)
<SpacerBottom size='1rem'/>
Different platforms require different rendering approaches, which is why multiple Lottie players exist.

Because Lottie animations are based on animation data rather than video files, they are lightweight and suitable for web and app interfaces.

## Types of Lottie Players
<SpacerBottom />
There are several Lottie players available, created by different companies and open-source communities. They can be grouped into three main categories.

<SpacerBottom size='1rem'/>
1. `Airbnb Players` (Core Engines).
<SpacerBottom size='1rem'/>
They are the original core rendering engines created by Airbnb. They do the actual work of parsing and rendering Lottie animations.
<SpacerBottom size='1rem'/>
Examples:
<SpacerBottom size='1rem'/>
- lottie-web
- lottie-ios
- lottie-android
<SpacerBottom size='1rem'/>
These players form the foundation of the Lottie.

2. `LottieFiles Players` (Product & Distribution Layer)
<SpacerBottom size='1rem'/>
LottieFiles players focus on:
<SpacerBottom size='1rem'/>
- Easy embedding
- Cross-platform sharing
- Previews
<SpacerBottom size='1rem'/>
Examples:
<SpacerBottom size='1rem'/>
- @lottiefiles/lottie-player
- @lottiefiles/react-lottie-player
- .lottie format and DotLottie players
<SpacerBottom size='1rem'/>
Most LottieFiles players wrap lottie-web and do not replace the core rendering engine. They sit above Airbnb's core layer and provide convenience and tooling.

<SpacerBottom />
3. `Framework-Specific Wrappers` (Adapter Layer)
<SpacerBottom size='1rem'/>
Framework-specific wrappers are thin adapters that:

- Adapt Lottie engines to framework
- Expose Props
- Handle mounting, unmounting, and updates
<SpacerBottom size='1rem'/>

These wrappers make Lottie feel native within each framework.
<SpacerBottom size='1rem'/>
Examples include players for:
<SpacerBottom size='1rem'/>
- React
- React Native
- Vue
- Expo

## How Lottie Players Work Together
<SpacerBottom />
All Lottie players are different because the platforms and frameworks they run on are different.
They are designed to work together, not to replace one another.
<SpacerBottom size='1rem'/>
Lottie players are stacked, not interchangeable:
<SpacerBottom size='1rem'/>
- Core engines handle rendering
- Wrappers adapt them to frameworks
- Tooling layers improve usability
<SpacerBottom size='1rem'/>
A full list of Lottie players can be found at
https://developers.lottiefiles.com/ and in other community resources.

## Scope of This Section
<SpacerBottom />
In this section, we focus on `practical Lottie animation integration`. This section explains how to add commonly used Lottie players that allow Lottie animations to play smoothly `across different platforms and frameworks`. We also cover `how to edit added animations on the fly` with minimal implementation effort and see the results immediately.
