# Lottie File Format And Lottie Players
<SpacerBottom />
In this article, we focus on what the 
<span style="color: var(--sl-color-accent-high);">Lottie</span> animation file format is and describe some of the 
<span style="color: var(--sl-color-accent-high);">Lottie players</span> that allow Lottie animations to play across different platforms and frameworks.

## What Is Lottie?
<SpacerBottom />
Lottie is a vector animation format designed for lightweight and scalable animations. It uses `JSON` to represent animation data and was created by Airbnb in 2017.

At its core, a Lottie animation is:

- A **JSON** file
- **Describes animation data** such as shapes, paths, colors, transforms, and timing
- **Resolution-independent**, so it scales without losing quality

## What Are Lottie Players?
<SpacerBottom />
A Lottie file is **only data**. By itself, it does nothing.

<SpacerBottom size='1rem'/>
A **Lottie player** is the runtime that:
<SpacerBottom size='1rem'/>
- **Reads** the Lottie JSON file
- **Interprets** the animation instructions
- **Renders** the animation using SVG, Canvas, or native drawing APIs (iOS / Android)

Because Lottie animations are based on animation data rather than video files, they are lightweight and suitable for web and app interfaces.

There are several Lottie players available, created by different companies and open-source communities.
They parse and render Lottie animations:

Different platforms require different rendering approaches, which is why multiple Lottie players exist.
