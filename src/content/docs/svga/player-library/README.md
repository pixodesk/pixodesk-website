How to install and use the player libraries that render and control **JSON** animations:
plain HTML, React, Vue and React Native, plus the playback settings and triggers they all
share. (Playing a **pre-rendered SVG** needs no library — see
[Pre-rendered SVG documentation](https://pixodesk.com/docs/svga/prerendered-svg).)
