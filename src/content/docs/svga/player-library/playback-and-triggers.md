Change how an animation plays — its length, loops, direction, what starts it — without going
back to the editor. Everything about *when* and *how* it plays lives in one place, the
document's `animator` block, and every player lets you **override it at runtime** from
component props or the player API. This page is the reference for those fields and the
overrides.

The editor writes the same block from its playback panel; if you only want to set the
defaults there, see
[Set default playback settings & triggers](https://pixodesk.com/docs/svga/editor/playback-settings).

A document with its `animator` block. (The comments are explanatory; JSON does not allow
comments, so a real file has none.)

```js px-player
{
  "type": "svg",
  "viewBox": "0 0 400 400",

  // Everything about WHEN and HOW the animation plays lives here
  "animator": {
    "timeline": {
      "duration": 2000,
      "iterations": "infinite",
      "direction": "alternate",
      "trigger": { "startOn": "scrollIntoView", "outAction": "pause", "scrollIntoViewThreshold": 0.5 }
    }
  },
  "children": [
    {
      "type": "circle",
      "id": "ball",
      "cx": 0, "cy": 0, "r": 40, "fill": "#0087ff",
      "animate": {
        "translate": {
          "keyframes": [
            { "time": 0,    "value": [200, 60],  "easing": [0.33, 0, 0.67, 0.33] },
            { "time": 2000, "value": [200, 340] }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The same bouncing ball as in the [web player](./web-player.md#declarative--data-px-animation-src),
now two seconds per bounce and waiting until half of it has scrolled into view.

## The `timeline` — what advances the playhead

`animator.timeline` says what *drives* the animation's progress, exactly like a Web Animations
API timeline. Its `type` picks one of three, mirroring WAAPI's `DocumentTimeline` /
`ScrollTimeline` / `ViewTimeline`:

<!-- px-check schema PxTimelineSchema values=type -->
| `timeline.type` | The playhead follows… |
|---|---|
| `time` (default — may be omitted) | wall time — something *starts* it (the `trigger`), and it has the playback dynamics below |
| `scroll` | a scroll container's offset — [Scroll-driven playback](#scroll-driven-playback-in-development) |
| `view` | the SVG's journey through the viewport — [Scroll-driven playback](#scroll-driven-playback-in-development) |

Each type carries only the fields that mean something for it — a scrubbed timeline has no
`trigger` or `delay`, and the format gives them no slot there. Omitting `timeline` entirely
means a time-driven timeline with every default.

## Timing

Timing, the playback dynamics, how the animated attributes get updated and at what rate ALL live in the
timeline. `animator` itself keeps only what is not playback: the lookup tables
(`definitions`, `bindings`) and the `debugGlobalName` handle.

<!-- px-check schema PxAnimatorConfigSchema partial -->
| Field | Values | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `timeline.duration` | ms | `1000` | length of **one** pass of the timeline. Keyframe times are absolute offsets within it |
| `timeline.frameRate` | fps | uncapped | target rate for the player's frame loop only — a parameter of the engine `timeline.engine` selects, so it sits beside it |
| `timeline.engine` | `auto` · `native` · `js` | `auto` | how the animated attributes get updated — [Engine](#engine) |
| `timeline.delay` | ms | `0` | wait this long, then start. A **negative** value skips ahead instead: `-500` starts right away from the frame at 0.5 s, as if the animation had already been running for half a second |
| `timeline.iterations` | number · `"infinite"` | `1` | how many times the whole document timeline repeats |
| `timeline.direction` | `normal` · `reverse` · `alternate` · `alternate-reverse` | `normal` | `alternate` ping-pongs on every other iteration |
| `timeline.fillMode` | `forwards` · `backwards` · `both` · `none` | `forwards` | what is shown *outside* the active time: `forwards` holds the last frame after the end; `backwards` shows the first frame during the delay; `none` reverts to the static SVG |
| `timeline.trigger.finishAction` | `hold` · `reset` | `hold` | after a natural finish: keep the end state (per `timeline.fillMode`), or snap back to the start |

**Per-property loops vs `iterations`.** There are two kinds of repetition, and they work at
different levels. `iterations` repeats the **whole document** — every element, from the first
keyframe to the last. A single property can also `loop` on its own: a segment of *its own*
keyframes repeats until it fills the document's duration, while everything else plays through
once (see [JSON format → Per-property loops](../format/README.md#per-property-loops)). The property loop is
applied first, when the document is prepared; `iterations` then repeats the result. So both
can be used at once, and one runs inside the other: a wheel whose rotation loops, inside a
document set to infinite iterations, keeps spinning during every iteration.

## Engine

`timeline.engine` says **how the animated attributes get updated** — the same three values on every timeline type:

<!-- px-check values PxTimelineEngineSetting pkg=core -->
| Value | Time-driven timeline | Scroll / view timeline |
|---|---|---|
| `auto` (default) | the Web Animations API — played by the browser itself, so it stays smooth even while the page is busy — with an **automatic fallback** to the player's frame loop when the document animates something WAAPI cannot express (path morphing, gradient geometry, filters, text on a path, …) | the browser's own `ScrollTimeline` / `ViewTimeline` where supported; otherwise the player measures scroll progress itself and drives WAAPI (or the frame loop, if WAAPI declines the document) |
| `native` | Web Animations API only | the browser's `ScrollTimeline` / `ViewTimeline` driving WAAPI (where unsupported, the player measures progress instead — WAAPI stays) |
| `js` | a `requestAnimationFrame` loop that writes attributes every frame; honors `frameRate`; universal browser support | the player measures scroll progress *and* applies values through its frame loop — identical everywhere |

Leave it on `auto` unless you need a guarantee — for instance `js` for path morphing in
Safari < 18.5. React Native ignores `engine` (playback is always native-driven).

Core exports the three helpers the players decide this with, so a player of your own lands on the
same answer rather than a similar one: `resolveTimelineEngine` turns the document's setting into
the engine that will actually run, `isNativeForced` says whether `native` was asked for outright,
and `mayUseNativeScrollTimeline` whether a scroll timeline may be handed to the browser's own
`ScrollTimeline`.

## Triggers — what *starts* the animation

The `trigger` block — inside the clock timeline — says what starts the animation and what
happens when that condition ends. The editor writes it from its **Start** setting; every
player honors it:

```json
"timeline": { "trigger": { "startOn": "mouseOver", "outAction": "reset" } }
```

<!-- px-check values PxStartOn pkg=core -->
| `startOn` | Starts when… | Editor label |
|---|---|---|
| `load` (default) | the animation is displayed | *On load* |
| `scrollIntoView` | the element becomes visible; `scrollIntoViewThreshold` says how much of it must be on screen first: `0` (default) any part, `0.5` half of it, `1` all of it | *When visible* |
| `mouseOver` | the pointer enters the element | *On mouse over* |
| `click` | the element is clicked (a second click applies `outAction`) | *On click* |
| `programmatic` | never by itself — you call `play()` | *Manually from JS* |

A document with no `trigger`, or a `trigger` without `startOn`, starts on load — every player
applies the same defaults. Use `programmatic` when your own code should start it.

Those defaults are `PX_TRIGGER_DEFAULTS`, and `resolveTrigger` fills them into a trigger that
leaves fields out — one resolution every player shares, instead of four that drift apart.

`outAction` says what happens when the trigger condition ends (pointer leaves, scrolled out,
second click):

<!-- px-check values PxOutAction pkg=core -->
| `outAction` | Effect |
|---|---|
| `continue` (default) | keep playing |
| `pause` | pause where it is; the next trigger resumes |
| `reset` | jump back to the start |
| `reverse` | play backwards to the start |

Where triggers work:

- **Every player** — web, React, Vue and React Native — supports all of them, with one
  exception: React Native has no `mouseOver`, because there is no hover on a touch screen.
- **Pre-rendered SVG + CSS animation + JS triggers** supports all of them too. The editor
  writes a few lines of script into the file for this; no library is involved.
- **Pre-rendered SVG + CSS animation** (no script at all) supports `load`, and `mouseOver`
  through CSS `:hover`. `click` and `scrollIntoView` cannot be done in pure CSS, so in this
  flavor they behave like `load` — the animation starts as soon as it is shown. See
  [Pre-rendered SVG](https://pixodesk.com/docs/svga/prerendered-svg/on-the-web#flavour-1--svg--css-animation).

## Overriding from a player

> **Example:** [`playback/override-web`](../../examples/docs-examples/src/cases/playback/override-web/) — `pnpm example:docs`, then open `#playback/override-web`.
> **Example:** [`playback/override-react`](../../examples/docs-examples/src/cases/playback/override-react/) — `pnpm example:docs`, then open `#playback/override-react`.

One document can play differently in each place you mount it — twice on the same page at two
speeds, or a file that autostarts everywhere except inside your own transport UI. Every player
takes the **same** override: a `timeline` object shaped exactly like the document's `animator`
block, deep-merged over what the file says. The file on disk is never modified.

**Web player**

```html
<div id="box" style="width: 300px; height: 300px"></div>
```

```js
import { createAnimator } from '@pixodesk/svg-animator-web';

const a = createAnimator({
  src: '/bouncing-ball.json',
  container: '#box',
  timeline: { iterations: 'infinite', trigger: { startOn: 'programmatic' } },
});
a.play();
```

**React / Vue / React Native** — the same object, as a prop:

```jsx
<PixodeskSvgAnimator doc={doc} autoplay
  timeline={{ iterations: 'infinite', trigger: { startOn: 'programmatic' } }} />
```

### How the merge works

<!-- px-check off the merge rules, prose -->
| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Objects merge, key by key** | `timeline: { duration: 2000 }` changes the duration and leaves `iterations`, `trigger` and everything else as the file has them |
| **Values replace** | numbers, strings and arrays are taken as given, never combined |
| **`null` deletes** | `{ timeline: { delay: null } }` removes the file's delay, restoring what its *absence* means. This is the only way to get a default back, because there is no value that spells "unset" |
| **Changing `timeline.type` starts over** | switching between a clock and a scroll timeline keeps only `duration`, `iterations`, `engine` and `frameRate` — the keys both kinds share. Clock-only keys (`trigger`, `delay`, `fillMode`, `direction`) have no meaning on a scroll timeline and are dropped, with a console warning |

The merge itself is core's, not each player's re-implementation. `applyAnimatorConfig` applies a
patch to a whole document; `mergeAnimatorConfig` does the same one level down, on the `animator`
block alone, and reports what it could and could not do in a `PxAnimatorConfigMergeResult`. Every
player calls `foldTimelineOverride` before either of them — it folds the four shortcuts below into
the patch and parses the JSON-string form. A patch is a `PxAnimatorConfigPatch`, and the `timeline`
part of one a `PxTimelinePatch`.

### The four shortcuts

The keys people reach for most also exist as plain props / options, because
`duration={2000}` reads better than a nested object:

<!-- px-check props PxTimelineShortcuts pkg=core -->
| Shortcut | Same as |
| --- | --- |
| `duration` | `timeline.duration` |
| `delay` | `timeline.delay` |
| `iterations` | `timeline.iterations` |
| `startOn` | `timeline.trigger.startOn` |

A shortcut wins over the same key inside `timeline`, the way an inline style beats a stylesheet.

### Starting from the defaults instead

`timeline` edits what the file says. To *ignore* the file's playback settings and start from the
player's own defaults, add `resetTimeline`:

```jsx
<PixodeskSvgAnimator doc={doc} resetTimeline timeline={{ duration: 3000 }} />
```

That plays for 3 s with default timing whatever the file declares. Fonts and the per-element
animation tables (`definitions`, `bindings`) are always kept — they are the animation
itself, not playback settings.

### A note on the components' control props

The components switch the trigger to `programmatic` whenever you use `play` / `pause` /
`progress` / `time`, so only `autoplay` mode uses the trigger saved in the file. `apiRef` is not
a control prop — the handle is filled in every mode and never changes which one you are in.

One shared rule decides that, so React, Vue and React Native cannot answer it three ways:
`resolveControlMode` reads the control props — typed `PxControlProps` — and returns the
`PxControlMode` that wins, together with a ready-made sentence for any conflict between two tiers.
`controlModeTakesOverTrigger` then says whether that mode must take the document's own trigger
over, which is true of every mode except `autoplay`.

> **Mangled builds.** `timeline` also accepts a **JSON string** —
> `timeline='{"duration":2000}'` — which survives a build that renames object keys.
> See [Minification](./minification.md).

## Debug handle — `debugGlobalName`

`"animator": { "debugGlobalName": "heroBanner" }` makes the player publish its API object as
`window.heroBanner`, so you can drive a live instance from the browser console —
`heroBanner.pause()`, `heroBanner.setCurrentTime(500)`, and so on. Purely a debugging
convenience; remove it (or leave it — it has no other effect) for production files.

## Scroll-driven playback (in development)

> **In development.** Scroll-driven playback is not finished yet: the fields below may change,
> and not every combination works in every player. Time-driven playback — the default — is
> not affected.

Instead of playing on a clock, the animation can **follow the scroll position** — the playhead
moves as the user scrolls: scroll down and the animation goes forward, scroll back up and it
goes backward, stop and it stays on that frame. This is the model of CSS scroll-driven
animations. Choose
*Timeline → scroll* in the editor's playback panel, or set it in the document:

```js
"animator": {
  // The playhead follows the SVG's journey through the viewport instead of the clock;
  // `duration` is the keyframe span the scroll range maps onto.
  "timeline": { "type": "view", "duration": 3000, "range": { "start": { "phase": "entry", "fraction": 0 }, "end": { "phase": "exit", "fraction": 1 } } }
}
```

`timeline: { "type": "view" }` alone means *"show the whole animation, first frame to last, as
the SVG travels across the viewport — the scroll position, not the clock, decides which frame
is on screen"*; `type: "scroll"` follows the scroll container's offset instead. The clock
fields (`trigger`, `delay`, `"infinite"`) have no slot in these timelines. The rest of the
object tunes it:

<!-- px-check schema PxTimelineSchema variant=scroll omit=duration,frameRate -->
| `timeline.` | Values | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `type` | `view` · `scroll` | progress = the SVG's journey across the scrollport, or the scroll container's offset ratio |
| `axis` | `block` (default) · `inline` · `x` · `y` | which axis; `block` = vertical in normal writing mode |
| `source` | `nearest` (default) · `root` | for `type: scroll` — the nearest scrollable ancestor, or the document |
| `subject` | `parent` · `scroller` · a CSS selector | for `type: view` — **whose** journey is measured (default: the `<svg>` itself). `parent` is what makes a *pinned* section work |
| `range.start` / `range.end` | `{ phase, fraction }` | the slice of the journey mapped to 0–100 %; `phase` ∈ `cover` (default) · `contain` · `entry` · `exit` · `entry-crossing` · `exit-crossing`; `fraction` is a position within that phase, `0` = its start, `1` = its end |
| `iterations` | number | the animation repeats this many times across the range (finite only — `"infinite"` cannot map onto a range) |
| `smoothing` | ms | catch-up lag — the playhead eases toward the scroll position instead of snapping (smoother under momentum scrolling) |
| `pin` | `true` · `{ align, offset, distance }` | hold the canvas still on screen while scrolling moves the animation forward and back (`position: sticky`); `align` ∈ `top`/`center`/`bottom`, `offset` in px from the aligned position, `distance` in viewport heights creates the scroll travel |
| `engine` | `auto` (default) · `native` · `js` | who computes progress and applies values — see [Engine](#engine): `auto`/`native` use the browser's `ScrollTimeline` where supported, `js` measures itself |

Support: the **web player** (both engines, and therefore React and Vue), and the *SVG + JS
animation* export. Not yet: the CSS export or React Native. The complete "scrollytelling"
pattern is `subject: "parent"` + `pin: true` inside a tall section.
