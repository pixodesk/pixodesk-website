# Add Lottie Animation to React App

You can add Lottie animations to a React app very easily. The most common and recommended way is to use the lottie-react package.

This is clean, modern way step by step.

---

## Create React project

```bash
cd path/to/your/projects
```
Then:

```bash
npm create vite@latest my-animation-app -- --template react-ts
```

This creates a React + TypeScript project called my-animation-app.

Now go into it:
```bash
cd my-animation-app
```
Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start dev server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

You should see:
```bash
Local: http://localhost:5173
```

---

## Install Lottie for React

In your React project folder, run:

```bash
npm install lottie-react
```

---

## Make or take existing Lottie animation file

**Option 1:** Create animation in 2D Animator

<pre><span class='url-link'><a href="https://pixodesk.com/2d-animator" target="blank">https://pixodesk.com/2d-animator</a></span></pre>

**Option 2:** Download from LottieFiles

<pre><span class='url-link'><a href="https://lottiefiles.com" target="blank">https://lottiefiles.com</a></span></pre>


Create an assets folder (if does not exist) and add your animation:

```bash
src/assets/animation.json
```

---

## Use Lottie in your React Component

```tsx
import Lottie from "lottie-react";
import animationData from "./assets/animation.json";


function App() {
    return (
        <div>
            <Lottie 
                animationData={animationData}
                loop={true}
                autoplay={true}
                style={{ width: 300, height: 300 }}
            />
            {/* ... The rest of your code */}
        </div>
    );
}

export default App;

```

---


## Done! 🎉

Your Lottie animation should now work in your React project.
