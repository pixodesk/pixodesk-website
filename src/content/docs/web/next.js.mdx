# Add Lottie Animation to Next.js Project

You can add Lottie animations to a Next.js app easily using the `lottie-react` package.

---

## Create Next.js Project

Open terminal and navigate to your projects folder:

```bash
cd path/to/your/projects
```

Create a new Next.js project with TypeScript:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-animation-app --typescript
```


During setup, choose:
- Which linter would you like to use?: **ESLint**
- Would you like to use React Compiler?: **No**
- Would you like to use Tailwind CSS?: **Yes or No (depends on your preferences)** 
- Would you like your code inside a src/ directory?: **Yes or No (depends on your preferences)** 
- Would you like to use App Router?: (recommended): **Yes** 
- Would you like to customize the import alias (@/* by default)?: (recommended): **No** 




Enter your project directory:

```bash
cd my-animation-app
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should see: `Local: http://localhost:3000`

## Install Lottie for Next.js

```bash
npm install lottie-react
```

---

## Get Your Lottie Animation

**Option 1:** Create animation in 2D Animator
- <a href="https://pixodesk.com/2d-animator" target="_blank">https://pixodesk.com/2d-animator</a>

**Option 2:** Download from LottieFiles
- <a href="https://lottiefiles.com" target="_blank">https://lottiefiles.com</a>

Create an animations folder and add your animation:

```bash
app/animations/animation.json
```

---

## Create Lottie Component

Create a client component since Lottie needs browser APIs:

**app/components/LottieAnimation.tsx**

```tsx
"use client";

import Lottie from "lottie-react";
import animationData from "../animations/animation.json";

export default function LottieAnimation() {
    return (
        <div>
            <Lottie 
                animationData={animationData}
                loop={true}
                autoplay={true}
                style={{ width: 300, height: 300 }}
            />
        </div>
    );
}
```


**"use client" directive:**

Remember to add `"use client"` at the top of components using Lottie, as it requires browser APIs.

---

## Use in Your Page

**app/page.tsx**

```tsx
import LottieAnimation from "./components/LottieAnimation";

export default function Home() {
    return (
        <main className="flex min-h-screen items-center justify-center">
            <LottieAnimation />
            {/* The rest of your code */}
        </main>
    );
}
```

---

## Done! 🎉

Your Lottie animation should now work in your Next.js project.
