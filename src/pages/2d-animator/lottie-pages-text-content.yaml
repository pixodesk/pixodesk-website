              Lottie is an open-source animation file format and runtime library developed by Airbnb.
              The Lottie file format is a JSON-based animation file that describes motion graphics, which can include vector graphics, raster images, and text.
              Lottie animations are designed to be lightweight and scalable, making them ideal for use in mobile apps, websites, and other digital platforms.
              Lottie: https://airbnb.io/lottie/
              Wikipedia about Lottie: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lottie_(file_format)

          - title: Vector-Based Graphics
            icon: ../assets/lottie/pages/vector-curve.svg
            text: Lottie animations are based on vector graphics, which means they can scale without losing quality. This makes them suitable for a variety of screen sizes and resolutions. 

          - title: JSON Format
            icon: ../assets/lottie/pages/code-json.svg
            text: Lottie animations are defined in a JSON-based file format, making them lightweight and easily readable. The JSON file contains information about the animation, including vector shapes, keyframes, and other properties.

          - title: Interactivity
            icon: ../assets/lottie/pages/gesture-double-tap.svg
            text: Lottie animations can be interactive, allowing developers to add user interactions and gestures to enhance the user experience.

          - title: Small File Sizes
            icon: ../assets/lottie/pages/arrow-collapse-vertical.svg
            text: Lottie animations are typically smaller in file size compared to other animation formats, making them efficient for web and mobile applications where bandwidth and storage considerations are important.

          - title: Cross-Platform Compatibility
            icon: ../assets/lottie/pages/devices.svg
            text: With Lottie, developers can create animations that work seamlessly across different platforms, reducing the need to create and maintain separate animations for each platform.

          - title: Community Support
            icon: ../assets/lottie/pages/account-group.svg
            text: Lottie has gained popularity and has a vibrant community of designers and developers who contribute animations and provide support. This has led to a rich collection of pre-built animations that developers can use in their projects.

          - title: High-Quality Animations
            icon: ../assets/lottie/pages/animation-play.svg
            text: Lottie supports high-quality animations with smooth transitions and precise control over timing and easing functions.

          - title: Playback Control
            icon: ../assets/lottie/pages/play-speed.svg
            text: Developers can control various aspects of animation playback, including speed, loop behavior, and direction.

          - title: Text Layers
            icon: ../assets/lottie/pages/format-text-variant-outline.svg
            text: Lottie animations can include text layers, providing the ability to animate and display dynamic text content within the animations.
          
          - title: Masking
            icon: ../assets/lottie/pages/drama-masks.svg
            text: Lottie supports masking techniques, allowing developers to create complex visual effects by revealing or hiding parts of the animation.
          
          - text: Overall, Lottie simplifies the process of adding high-quality animations to digital projects and has become a popular choice in the design and development community. It's important to note that the specific features and capabilities of Lottie animations can depend on the version of the Lottie library being used and the platform or framework in which it is implemented. Developers should refer to the documentation and resources specific to their chosen platform for detailed information on Lottie animation features.
